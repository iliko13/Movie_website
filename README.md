# React + Vite + TailwindCSS

This is a responsive movie app which is fully made by me.

In this project I'm using React tools, such as:

1. React-router (v6) - use createBrowserRouter, useNavigate, useRouteError (new version of router, where I am using nested routes(parent and children routes)),
2. React-icons,

Furthermore,

3)Vite,
4)Tailwind.
